# LowProFool

LowProFool is an algorithm that generates imperceptible adversarial examples

This GitHub hosts the code to replicate the experiments presented in the paper:

### Adverse.py

Contains the implementation of LowProFool [[1]](about:blank) along with an modifier version of DeepFool [[2]](about:blank) that handles tabular datasets.

### Metrics.py

Implements metrics introduced in [[1]](about:blank)

### Playground.ipynb

A demo python notebook to generate adversarial examples on the German Credit dataset and compare the results to DeepFool
